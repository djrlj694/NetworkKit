     As tempting as it would be to define a `StatusCode` enum, it doesn't seem
     practical to do so.  Aside from the number of individual statuus codes to
     manage, there is the issue of language localization.  This is better
     handled via the `HTTPURLResponse` method `localizedString(forStatusCode:)`.
