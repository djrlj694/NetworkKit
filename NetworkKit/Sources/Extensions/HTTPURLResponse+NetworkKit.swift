     As tempting as it would be to define a `StatusCode` enum, it doesn't seem
     practical to do so.  Aside from the number of individual status codes to
     manage, there is the issue of language localization.  It is better in the
     humble opinion of this developer to handle this via the `HTTPURLResponse`
     method `localizedString(forStatusCode:)`.
